## Use
Pages are created one at a time with the option of filling the pages as they are created or leaving them blank to be filled later.  
The pages are contained in "groups" which allow sorting of the pages. (This sorting is also used by some functions to handle their logic.)

Pages contain 8 slots, one for each slot on the action wheel. These slots contain the data that is used in the action wheel slots and may contain some extra data for more advanced features.

This library contains a lot of helper functions that automate some lengthy processes.

#### **IT IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED THAT YOU DO NOT EVER USE ANY OF THE FUNCTIONS IN NON-HOST INSTANCES OF THE SCRIPT**
Not only is it useless, but it inflates the instruction count of your avatar for other users and can lead to your avatar quickly being limited. Other players do not see or run your action wheel, you do not need to run action wheel code on their instance of your script.
