## Use
Allows multiple functions to apply layers to bones to avoid the functions from overwriting eachother.  
Also contains a system for bones to mimic other bones.

This library is fairly complex and may take some experimentation to figure out.

Due to the addition of Blockbench animations which already can be layered on top of each other (and don't add to the tick/render instruction cost,) this library will no longer be updated except to fix bugs.
