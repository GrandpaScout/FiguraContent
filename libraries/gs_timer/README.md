## Use
Timers keep track of how long they have been running. This allows other functions to keep track of the timer and react accordingly.  
Timers can also be given functions that they will run when they end or loop. This allows for delayed or repeating events.

Timers can be easily modified (*even while running*) to have any amount of total time, time remaining, or even loops remaining and can be restarted, stopped, or resumed with a single function call.
