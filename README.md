# Using my work
> If you plan to use this content in any way, I have a few requirements.  
> More detailed info is given in the respective folders of my content.
>
> The three main things I request of you, no matter what the content is are:
> * ## Give me credit and do not claim that my work is yours.
>   > ##### You are not required to credit me if you use my work as *inspiration* though I won't stop you. This means that you can create something similar by looking at how my scripts work, this does *not* mean you can change some variable names and move code around and call it "inspired".
>   > ##### If you upload something containing my work to the Figura showcase, please make sure to credit me appropriately in the showcase post.
> * ## Do not sell anything containing my work.
>   > ##### You don't own my work, so you shouldn't be able to earn from it.
>   > ##### *THERE ARE EXCEPTIONS!* These exceptions will be noted in the README of an individual avatar or library!
> * ## Let me know when you use something I've made!
>   > ##### You are *not* required to ask me before you use my work. By understanding these requests and respecting them, you have permission to use my work.
>   > ##### You are not *required* to tell me if you use something, but I would love to know how some of my creations are doing!
>
> If you use my work for *personal* reasons only, then you don't need to do any of the above.
> > You already know who made it, why do you need to put in credits?  
> > You can't sell something to yourself.  
> > And you don't really need to let me know about private/personal things.
>
> Understand that I request these things to protect my work.  
> I do not intend to get in your way or make your life harder.  
> The reason this is so lengthy is so you don't have to suffer misunderstandings.
