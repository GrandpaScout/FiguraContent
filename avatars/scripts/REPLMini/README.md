Adds an interactive and extensive REPL to Figura.  
Supports all native types (including Figura's `vector` type.)

Press <kbd>̃˴</kbd> to toggle the REPL.  
To input something into the REPL, start typing in chat and press <kbd>ENTER</kbd> to submit.

This is a much smaller version of the normal REPL and is missing many of the features in favor of taking up less space.
