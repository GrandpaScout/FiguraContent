Adds an interactive and extensive REPL to Figura.  
Supports all native types (including Figura's `vector` type.)

***THIS SCRIPT WILL LIKELY CAUSE YOUR AVATAR TO FAIL FOR OTHER PLAYERS WHEN `FORMAT SCRIPT` IS ENABLED. EITHER SWAP TO THE REPL LOADER OR TURN OFF SCRIPT FORMATTING BEFORE UPLOADING.***

Press <kbd>̃˴</kbd> to toggle the REPL.  
To input something into the REPL, start typing in chat and press <kbd>ENTER</kbd> to submit.

The REPL also has "SuperActions" that allow more control that the REPL doesn't normally allow. To view all SuperActions, submit `$$#`.
