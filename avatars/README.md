# Figura Avatars
Contains avatars made by me, GrandpaScout.

## Full Avatars (`full_avatars`)
Contains avatars that come with at least a model and a script or texture.  
I rarely ever make full avatars. It is unlikely you'll find much in here.

## Model Only (`model_only`)
Contains avatars that are only a model. May also contain a texture if needed.  
I rarely ever just make models. It is unlikely you'll find much in here.

## Script Only (`script_only`)
Contains avatars that are only a script. May also contain miscellaneous files.  
This is most of what I do and this category will likely have the most things.

The scripts can be anything from crosshair fixes to REPLs.  
If you are looking for generic libraries, they are found at `../libraries/`
