# Figura Avatars
Contains avatars made by me, GrandpaScout.

## Full Avatars (`avatars`)
Contains avatars that are meant to be used as is or with little modification.  
I rarely ever make full avatars. It is unlikely you'll find much in here.

## Parts (`parts`)
Contains avatars that can be put together with other models or used alone.  
I rarely ever just make models. It is unlikely you'll find much in here.

## Scripts (`scripts`)
Contains avatars that are only a script. May also contain other miscellaneous files.  
This is most of what I do and this category will likely have the most things.

The scripts can be anything from crosshair fixes to REPLs.  
If you are looking for generic libraries, they are found at `../libraries/`
